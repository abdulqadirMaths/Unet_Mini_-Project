# Mini UNet Project (Circle Segmentation)

This is a small learning project where I made a fake dataset of circles and trained a UNet model to segment them. 
I am still learning deep learning, so this project is not perfect, just for practice.

Files:
- dataset.py : code for generating circle images
- model.py : UNet model
- train.py : training code
- predict.py : prediction and visualization

How to run:
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python train.py
3. python predict.py
